    <h1>Linux vs Windows: an in-depth review</h1>

    <img src="linux-more-secure-than-windows-980x551.webp" alt="Linux vs Windows">

    <p>Yes, I'm not the first one coming with a typical Linux vs Windows battle. I am aware of the controversial situation between the two OS's. 
    But, speaking from my own experience, I came to a very easy, yet interesting conclusion...</p>

    <h2>First: Windows</h2>

    <p>Let's start with Windows: arguably the most used OS for desktops and workstations. Very practical for smaller, but also for bigger enterprises, focused on 24/7 support from Microsoft. 
    Windows offers a variety of services and applications, such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Microsoft Office 365. Windows is stable in its software and usage.</p>

    <p>So why the fuss when it comes to which OS is better? I'll discuss that when I've summarised the basics of Linux.</p>

    <h2>Linux: the loyal penguin</h2>

    <p>A big misconception with Linux is that it's an OS on its own, but if we refer to Linux, we actually speak of a kernel. A kernel is a piece of code (mostly written in the programming language C) which sits between the software of the OS and the hardware of your device. It makes sure that the two components communicate well.</p>

    <p>So, what operating system is built on Linux. Let me tell you: a lot! Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kali, Parrot, the list goes on and on. We call these Linux distributions, or in short: distros. The beauty of Linux, is that it's open source. Which means that you can distribute the code, edit it and in the first place see it. The customizations you can perform on your Linux machine are endless. You are truly in control on your machine. On one side it sounds amazing. On the other side though: with great power comes great responsibility. Using Linux demands a layer of common knowledge about the system. In a nutshell, all the distros work and operate the same: through the Linux kernel. The visuals, desktop manager, and package manager for example are the main components that differ for each distro.</p>

    <p>Getting back to the use of Linux, it has some downsides. For example, in my opinion, Linux is less stable than Windows. To not cause emotional reactions from the Linux fanboys, older versions of various distros are well-tested and trusted. So about as stable as Windows. But newer 'cutting edge' versions tend to get a bit unreliable.</p>

    <p>Alright, enough Linux. Let's compare!</p>

    <p>First and foremost, let me tell you how I compare the two 'rivals'. I will divide the comparison between a few categories:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Security</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
      <li>Reliability</li>
      <li>Ease of use</li>
      <li>Applications and software</li>
      <li>Company and enterprise use</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>As humans, we tend to overcomplicate things. We can’t simply say “Linux is safer” or “Windows is safer.” I have discussed open-source software before. Well, closed-source software also exists. Windows is closed-source, which means you cannot access or modify its source code.</p> 
    <p>When source code is open, vulnerabilities and bugs are easier for the community to find and fix. On Windows, when bugs or errors occur, only Microsoft can access the source code, which can make the fixing process longer. However, once detected, patches are often delivered quickly through automatic updates. In conclusion, depending on the type of problem, Linux is usually quicker to receive a fix.</p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>

   <p>When talking about speed, of course there are different aspects to consider. For example, start-up time: Linux usually starts faster because the distros are more lightweight. Windows has more background processes running, which naturally results in slower start-up times.</p> 
   <p>System-wise, Linux is generally much more efficient than Windows. It runs far fewer background processes and is often more compatible with older hardware. From my own experience, a regular Ubuntu Desktop uses about 2.4 GB of RAM when idle (no applications running), whereas Windows can use around 6–8 GB of RAM, depending on the number of applications. Windows simply requires more system resources to run smoothly.</p> 
   <p>For gaming, on the other hand, Windows benefits from better drivers that are more compatible with games, game launchers, and graphics performance.</p>


      <h2>Reliability</h2>

      <p>More than 90% of the servers used worldwide are Linux-based. This is because most Linux server versions are LTS, or Long Term Support, which means very few restarts are required, as updates are not necessary in the short term. In contrast, most Windows updates are mandatory and must be applied for the system to function properly. This is why the majority of servers worldwide run on a Linux distro.</p>

      <h2>Ease of Use</h2>

        <p>“Ease of use” is also a broad term. Let’s start with the installation. Windows is simply easier to install, mainly because it doesn’t give you the freedom to customize your system extensively. Linux, on the other hand, offers more options during the installation process, such as LVM, creating custom logical volumes, and so on. I don’t want to bore you, so I’ll stop here.</p>
        <p>Also, choosing the right distro can be a bit overwhelming. When I decided to use Linux for a while, I couldn’t settle on a single distro. I thought I was going crazy when my Arch installation didn’t succeed, for example, or when I was experimenting in Lubuntu with my desktop manager. But now I have finally found peace: I chose Ubuntu, primarily for its <em>ease of use</em>. Ubuntu is ideal. It is a relatively heavy distro with lots of software packages, yet it still uses only around 2.5 GB of RAM. It works perfectly.</p>

        <p>Now, for gamers, the choice is obvious: Windows is the first option. If your PC is capable of running games, it will almost certainly be compatible with Windows as well. However, if you are a Linux enthusiast, you can use Ubuntu. It runs Steam seamlessly, so Steam gamers will be well accommodated. Other game platforms, such as Rockstar Games or Epic Games, do not offer official Linux versions of their games.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, using Linux requires some basic knowledge of the system. However, for those who want to learn, it is not that difficult.</p>

        <h2>Applications and Software</h2>

        <p>Windows offers a great variety of software. Most software on Windows is paid and licensed. But before I criticize Windows too much, it’s important to note that paid software is often more stable and reliable. It usually has official distributors and lifetime support, which can be very helpful when experiencing bugs or crashes.</p>

        <p>Linux uses almost exclusively open-source alternatives to the paid software commonly used on Windows. You can truly use “open-source” and “free” in the same sentence, because it often is both. This software is developed by people with a passion for programming, and it frequently comes with excellent documentation and active discussion forums for troubleshooting or general questions.

        When it comes to which OS’s software is easier to use, it’s hard to define a clear winner. For example, AutoCAD doesn’t really have a proper alternative on Linux, and the same goes for Adobe products. For professional work such as video editing, graphic design, or animations, I would advise using Windows.</p>

        <h2>Company and Enterprise use</h2>


         <p>After reading everything I've written before, the last heading speaks for itself. Windows machines are easier to manage in a professional work environment, thanks to Active Directory, which makes it simple to add Windows workstations to a company domain. Additionally, Remote Desktop is built into Windows, allowing admins to easily access devices remotely to fix any issues. Linux simply doesn’t have a built-in equivalent. Remote access usually requires SSH, and integrating Linux machines into a domain is rarely practical due to its complexity.</p>

          <p>So yeah, what's my conclusion? After working with both operating systems, I can say that both are impressive, and there is no generally “better” one. The most important thing is to choose based on your situation and intended use. I would suggest that if you are a computer enthusiast and want to learn new software-related topics, a Linux distro is definitely the way to go for experimentation. If you want a ready-to-go laptop or PC, I would choose Windows, simply for its simplicity. The same goes for corporate environments: Windows.</p>

          <p>I hope you got something out of this. For extra in-depth information, I'll link a few vids down.</p>
